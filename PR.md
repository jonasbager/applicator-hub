# Add TheHub.io Job Scraping Integration

## Problem
The job recommendation system was only fetching jobs from LinkedIn, missing out on potential matches from TheHub.io. The Python scraping service for TheHub.io existed but wasn't integrated into the main application flow.

## Solution
Integrated TheHub.io job scraping directly into the `scrape-job.ts` Netlify function, which now:
1. Searches LinkedIn jobs as before
2. Additionally searches TheHub.io using the same keywords and location
3. Combines results from both sources before returning

### Key Changes
- Modified `scrape-job.ts` to handle both LinkedIn and TheHub.io job searches
- Added TheHub.io-specific selectors for job card parsing
- Improved error handling to continue even if one source fails
- Maintained existing job schema and matching logic

### Testing
To test this change:
1. Visit the Recommended Jobs page
2. Verify jobs appear from both LinkedIn and TheHub.io (check `source` field)
3. Confirm job matching and similarity scoring works for both sources

### Notes
- TheHub.io scraping uses the same proxy service (allorigins.win) as LinkedIn to avoid CORS issues
- Location handling defaults to "Remote" for non-Denmark locations on TheHub.io
- The Python scraping service can now be deprecated as it's no longer needed
