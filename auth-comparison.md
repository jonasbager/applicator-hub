   - Drop-in components for React
   - Less code to write and maintain
   - Simpler integration with existing code

2. **Better Developer Experience**
   - Excellent documentation
   - Built-in TypeScript support
   - Great dashboard for user management
   - Built-in analytics and monitoring

3. **Features Relevant to ApplyMate**
   - Email/password authentication (matches current flow)

   - Fully managed service
   - No need to host/maintain auth infrastructure
   - Regular security updates handled automatically

## SuperTokens Advantages
1. **Self-hosted Option**
   - Complete control over infrastructure
   - Data sovereignty
   - No vendor lock-in

2. **Open Source**
   - Can modify code if needed
   - Community contributions
   - Free forever for self-hosting

3. **Customization**
   - More control over auth flows

## Recommendation for ApplyMate: Use Clerk

### Reasons:
1. **Faster Implementation**
   - Clerk's pre-built components will make the migration faster
   - Less custom code needed = fewer potential bugs
   - Can focus on fixing auth issues rather than building infrastructure

2. **Perfect for Your Scale**
   - Free tier (10,000 users) is more than sufficient
   - Can upgrade if needed in the future
   - No need to manage infrastructure at this scale

3. **Better Auth Experience**
   - Solves your current password reset issues
   - Professional email templates out of the box
   - Built-in security best practices

4. **Minimal Changes Required**
   - Can keep existing UI/UX
   - Similar auth flows to current implementation
   - Easy to map to your current auth context

5. **Future-Proof**
   - Regular updates and security patches
   - New features added regularly
   - Professional support if needed

### Migration Path
1. Install Clerk SDK
2. Replace Supabase auth with Clerk components
3. Keep all other Supabase functionality (database, etc.)
4. Keep existing UI/UX
5. Only change auth-related code
